rrdtcl bindings are poorly ported to freebsd 5.X branch but if you want to fix it do that in the folowing steps

1. First you need tcl 8.4 libs
2. Then go to /usr/ports/net/rrdtool and edit file Makefile search for line CONFIGURE_ARGS= add 
"--with-tcllib=/usr/local/lib/tcl8.4" at the end of line.
3. Try to compile
4. If error accours that cant find tcl.h then you need to edit 
/usr/ports/net/rrdtool/work/rrdtool-1.2.19/bindings/tclrrd.c and change line "#include <tcl.h>" to "#include 
</usr/local/include/tcl8.4/generic/tcl.h>
then go to /usr/ports/net/rrdtool/ and try to make again without cleaning. It works :-)
